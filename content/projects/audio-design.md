Designing and implementing all sounds in a level in Unreal Engine

This was my exam project for the extra Audio Design course that I took. I am quite proud of what I've managed to produce here, as I put quite a few hours into the entire project.

## Ambient sounds

I created two ambient loops, one for each main area of the level



### Starting area

When playing through the starting area it felt quite homey and comfortable to me, so I decided to give the ambient a chill vibe, while also adding some alien chants as to not make the player feel too comfortable.



### Ending area

Because I thought the end area had a sort of sinister vibe to it, I decided to make the ambient for this area a bit more spooky and creepy. I started off with just a basic underwater room tone, and then added some weird alien sound effects which added to the strangeness of the area. In general this ambient is louder and more in-your-face, which adds to the creepy vibe because it's drowing out your footsteps a bit.





## Unreal Engine implementation

In general the implementation of my sounds into the level was quite painless, however during the setup I did encounter some bugs where sounds in a reverb volume wouldn't get any reverb. This resulted in me having to resort to an earlier version of Unreal.
