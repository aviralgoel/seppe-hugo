# Motivation

I built  **Can You Block It** to help people test if their ad-blocker is working as intended. 
Its a simple website that allows users to test ad-blockers such as 
AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, AdBlocker Ultimate, AdGuard, Ghostery, uBlock 
Origin, Pi-Hole, NoScript and more with various ad formats such as Web 
Banners, Native Ads, Pop-Unders,  In-Page Push Ads, etc from popular Ad 
Networks.

## Types of Tests

 I later implemented three levels of tests to help in identifying what formats of advertisements are blocked or unblocked. This allows users to see how far their adblockers works.

## Public Response

I also collected data at the end of the test and published the results to conclude which adblockers are most effective.

The project is live and still recieved about 10,000 hits per month primarly from Google search.
