After finishing the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com), I understood how the main concepts of the API work.

I absolutely loved working on this project, and loved learning a lot from all the little challenges that stood in my way.

Learning Vulkan can be a challenging endeavor, but I have managed to 
make significant progress by maintaining a consistent approach. 
Throughout my learning journey, one skill that has proven to be of 
utmost importance is the utilization of validation layers for debugging 
Vulkan errors. This ability to effectively understand validation layers 
has empowered me to identify and resolve issues
